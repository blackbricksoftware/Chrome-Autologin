  "readme": "# Chrome Extension generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension)\n\nMaintainer: [Jimmy Moon](https://github.com/ragingwind)\n\n> Chrome Extension generator that creates everything you need to get started with extension development. You can choose Browser UI(Browser,Page Action, Omnibox) type and select into permissions what you need.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- First make a new directory, and `cd` into it: mkdir my-new-chrome-extension && cd $_\n- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-chrome-extension`\n- Run: `yo chrome-extension`, optionally passing an extension name: yo chrome-extension [extension-name]\n\nNeed more information about Chrome Extension? Please visit [Google Chrome Extension Develpment](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide.html)\n\n![](http://recordit.co/H5y0XHYwgf.gif)\n\n## Generators\n\nAvailable generators:\n\n* [chrome-extension](#app) (aka [chrome-extension:app](#app))\n\n### App\n\nSets up a new Chrome Extension, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started.\n\n```bash\nyo chrome-extension\n```\n\n## Test Chrome Extension\n\nTo test, go to: chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode and load app as an unpacked extension.\n\n## Grunt tasks\n\n### Debug\n\nDebug task helps reduce your effors during development extensions. If the task detects your changes of source files, Livereload([chromereload.js](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension/blob/master/app/templates/scripts/chromereload.js)) reloads your extension. If you would like to know more about Livereload and preview of Yeoman? Please see [Getting started with Yeoman and generator-webapp](http://youtu.be/zBt2g9ekiug?t=3m51s) for your understanding.\n\n```bash\ngrunt debug\n```\n\n### Build\n\nBy default, generators compress the file that was created by building a js/css/html/resource file. You can distribute the compressed file using the Chrome Developer Dashboard to publish to the Chrome Web Store.\n\nRun this command to build your Chrome Extension project.\n\n```bash\ngrunt build\n```\n\n## Options\n\n* `--skip-install`\n\n  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after\n  scaffolding has finished.\n\n* `--test-framework=[framework]`\n\n  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for\n  another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.\n\n* `--coffee`\n\n  Add support for [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).\n\n* `--compass`\n\n  Add support for [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).\n\n > WARN, Compiled files that generated by coffee or compass will be remained if your Chrome App is running on Chrome App container (with `grunt debug`). You should remove or ignore that files if you don't want to commit to repo.\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee the [contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md)\n\n## License\n\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\n",
